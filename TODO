* TODO: modify-window: round to 1000ms between Windows and Linux
* TODO: queue for opening/closing file input streams in background thread
*      (opening file io takes a long time); maybe not worthwhile, network io takes longer
* TODO: if filenames differ just by upper/lower case, instead of overwrite,
*      create new file with ".1" appended (for Windows: BLAH.XYZ is the same as
*      blah.xyz)
* TODO: create empty directories; problem: can't just open outputstream, needs protocol change
* TODO: special case when file to send contains ":" in file name (on Windows)
* TODO: encrypt transfer
* TODO: resume copying after connection error or other breaks in transmission (like wget -c)

* DONE 27.6.2011: progress bar
* DONE 27.6.2011: test if file to send can be opened before transmitting file name (cygwin file name probs)
* DONE: Windows, cygwin output directory "-t h:/tmp" changes to "/cygdrive/h/H:/tmp/"
* DONE: bug with file in root directory: first character is dropped (rootless path) (15.7.2011)
